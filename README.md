# sentiment-analysis
Sentiment Analysis (binary classification - positive or negative) using Keras LSTM model with IMDB dataset as training data and Twitter dataset as testing data.

The general idea behind this experiment is to evaluate how well the model, which is trained on full sentences with a clear syntax (IMDB dataset), performs on sentences which are from a different distribution (Twitter dataset). After training the model, it is able to achieve about 74% accuracy on test data.

Data for training and testing can be found inside datasets folder.
